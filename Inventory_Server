$ lsblk  	-> to display the size of the hard drive with all the partitions		

$ lscpu 
$ nproc 
$ cat /proc/cpuinfo	  -> to display the characteristic of the cpu	

$ free -m  
$ top  
$ free -g 
$ cat /proc/meminfo	  -> to check the memory		

$ cat /etc/*release	  -> to check the OS version of your Linux server	

$ uname -r  
$ uname -a  
$ iostat  
$ cat /proc/version	   ->  to check the Kernel version
