Troubleshoot down server

    Step 1 : Check the server status
    check if I am able to access the server itself. 
    with ping (ping your_server_ip}
    ssh command (ssh username@xx.xx.xx.xx) 
    or typing URL of that application

    Step 2 : Check the latest logs generated from the server
    The logs will be usually present at directory /var/log . 
    if Ubuntu server, check with tail -f  /var/log/apache2 
    If Centos server, check with tail -f  /var/log/httpd.log
    If Nginx server, check with tail -f  /var/log/nginx/access.log

    Step 3 : Make sure the daemon is up and running
    Use status command to check if the service is up or not.
    service apache2 status
    service httpd status
    service nginx status

    Step 4 : Verifying the Syntax of Web server
    Debian and Ubuntu distributions : /etc/apache2/
    Fedora, CentOS distributions : /etc/httpd/
    Configuration Directories for Nginx is: /etc/nginx/
    to check the configuration syntax of your files.: apache2ctl -t ; httpd -t ; nginx -t

    Step 5 : Is Database back-end running Fine
    If you have configured your site to connect with database back-end like MySQL, PostreSQL, MongoDB, etc. 
    service mysql status
    service mysqld status
    service mongod status
    Alternately you can also verify with below netstat command
    netstat -ntlp | grep mysql

    Step 6 : Verify if Web/App server is able to connect to Database backend
    The configuration file is located in wp-config.php file.
    Need to check that the DB_NAME, DB_USER, and DB_PASSWORD are correct 
    You can test whether the file has the correct information 
    by trying to connect to the database manually by changing appropriate Value in below command
    mysql -hDB_Host -uDB_USER -pDB_PASSWORD 

    Step 7 : Make sure the Ports are open
    telnet your_server_ip 80
    telnet your_server_ip 443
    You can also verify if your App/Web server is able to connect to your database port on back-end.
    telnet your_database_server_ip 3306
    May need to open up port 80,port 443 or Port 3306 

    Step 8 : Verifying the DNS Setting
    You also need to make sure that your domain is correctly pointed to Server IP.
